  # Week 2 Blog 
### Alex Reynoso

In today's blog were going to discuss contents regarding week 2 material.

### What I learned about Markdown and Git, and how they help me contribute to open source and improve professionally?

There are many things that I learned through this material. A big one that stands out to me is Git and version control. Not exactly how to do it, but why it is very important in a large collaborative setting. Also, the use of github issues was fairly new to me, I learned that issues don't even have to be "issues" but rather can range from feature implementation to something very minor. I also learned new <sup>little </sup> **niche** ~~things~~. They're going to help me document things correctly, I cant neccessairly use markdown to code, but you can bet I will be using it do document.

### Have you used them before?

Surprisinly, I knew more about Git and Github with command lines rather than the interface. The interface makes things so much easier and I knew this, but to feel like a "coder" I prefered using the command line. I didn't know much about markdown prior to this seminar. Or so I thought... turns out notion uses a version of markdown, almost like markdown dialects. So it was nice to see somethings be the same which means technically I have used markdown before. It makes me wonder what other technologies I've come across that connect in a way I have yet to discover. 

### What surprised you about Markdown or Git?”

It was shocking to see how much easier using Github's interface is for all git purposes. As I mentioned I'm used to the command line and it's a lot of tedious commands. The interface just makes it 20x easier. Also, I didn't know markdown was used in the capacity it's used, I look around at documentation and open source code and it is used all the time which is cool to see.
