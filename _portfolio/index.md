  # Week 2 Blog 
### Alex Reynoso

In today's blog were going to discuss contents regarding week 2 material.

### What I learned about Markdown and Git, and how they help me contribute to open source and improve professionally?

There are many things that I learned through this material. A big one that stands out to me is Git and version control. Not exactly how to do it, but why it is very important in a large collaborative setting. Also, the use of github issues was fairly new to me, I learned that issues don't even have to be "issues" but rather can range from feature implementation to something very minor. I also learned new <sup>little </sup> **niche** ~~things~~. They're going to help me document things correctly, I cant neccessairly use markdown to code, but you can bet I will be using it do document.

### Have you used them before?

Surprisinly, I knew more about Git and Github with command lines rather than the interface. The interface makes things so much easier and I knew this, but to feel like a "coder" I prefered using the command line. I didn't know much about markdown prior to this seminar. Or so I thought... turns out notion uses a version of markdown, almost like markdown dialects. So it was nice to see somethings be the same which means technically I have used markdown before. It makes me wonder what other technologies I've come across that connect in a way I have yet to discover. 

### What surprised you about Markdown or Git?”

It was shocking to see how much easier using Github's interface is for all git purposes. As I mentioned I'm used to the command line and it's a lot of tedious commands. The interface just makes it 20x easier. Also, I didn't know markdown was used in the capacity it's used, I look around at documentation and open source code and it is used all the time which is cool to see.

  # WHY CHOOSE OPEN SOURCE?
<img width="640" height="410" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efcff872-b6f1-4129-a6af-4820ffa75e03" />

# Wait... maybe I shouldn't choose open source?

### Do you ever want to contibute to something bigger than yourself? Something so magnificent and glorious that you don't know where to start? Something that is going to not give you any pay at all but be seriously cool?
If your answer is **yes** then you are in the right place. Welcome to my take on open source and my journey in choosing an open source project. Open source is the voluntary contribution to openly available code. 
Now that we know that. Let's talk about what open source project I choose to pick to [freeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/main/README.md). To be honest, the main reason for choosing this is because
I have learned on the website, and if I can help other people learn, even in a minimal way, i'm going to take that opportunity. I found it very neatly organized which is surprising, when you have thousands of people contributing to one thing,
you imagine chaos, i'm not saying I did not find chaos. I'm saying I found organized and neat chaos. The contribution process seems very legit and possible, there are guides on how to do so which is another reason I chose it. What I am trying to say is 
**contribute to open source! You have nothing to lose and everything to gain!**

    # Alex's Take on Reveal.js

  ## Reveal.js? What are we revealing? Revealing javascript? javascript reveal? What is **reveal.js??!?!?**
  <img width="400" height="600" alt="image" src="/assets/images/github_repo.png" />

  ## Have no fear, welcome to Reveal.js 101 <sub>_alex edition 2005_</sub>

  ### How is reveal.js structured?
  **On a technical level, reveal.js is structured as follows**
    - js/ main bulk of code
    - css/ makes it look pretty
    - plugin/ different modifiers
    - examples/ tests and demos
  All this to say its well strucuted and if you want answers to your questions, they aren't difficult to find.
  ### Awesome, okay now what is reveal.js used for?
  Have you ever wanted to make a cool slide show but you're sick of the boring google slides and powerpoint? Let me tell you I have been there. Look no more! Reveal.js solves all those problems for you with a very unique and cool way to throw up a presentation using html and javascript.
  You could even use markdown to edit the slides which is pretty unique. Take a look at this [demo](https://revealjs.com/demo/?view=scroll)! <sub>HOW COOL IS IT _VERTICAL_ SLIDES!</sub> 

  ### Sounds pretty cool right? Just you wait.
  I think the documented and maintained code is very cool for many reasons. Firstly, the examples you can easily throw up, it takes > 5 minutes to dive right in and be able to edit your own slides. The demos are **VERY** informational, teaching you everything you need to know
  front and back. The READ.ME file is also very clear and consice. Maintaining wise, reveal.js is very well maintained. There is a lot of recent acitivity showing there are people out there taking good care of this great tool.
  I think I could contibute in minimal ways. Documentaion wise I wouldnt struggle, actually creating features and fixing bugs would be a different ball game. For a couple reasons, the main being my html/css/js knowledge isn't that deep. I do think if I put my mind to it I can
  do it though. <sub>To be honest, frontend isn't that interesting to me... Backend is where my heart lives.</>

    # BP05 - Welcome back to Alex's blog post. In today's post we are going to go into the world of Ownership, Access, and Innovation: What I learned about Licensing. 
  ## Reflect on something you learned about open source licenses (e.g., MIT vs GPL, what’s allowed, what’s restricted).
  Firstly, there is a **lot** I learned about licensing. Lets get right into it. Below is a chart going into the differences
  of some of the licensing I learned about.
  | **MIT**| BSD |
  |----------|----------|
  | Most common license.|Very common license |
  |Permits reuse in proprietary and commercial software.| Requires an inclusion of copyright notice |
  |Unclear if patent rights are waved| May require advertising acknowledgement|


  The reason I included these was because these are the **most used open source licenses**.


  ## How did the Tetris movie shape your understanding of software ownership and distribution?
  ![meme](/assets/images/smol_kitties.jpeg)


  In other words, I thought this topic would be uninteresting to me, but after watching this movie my interest grew and I saw the topic in a whole new light. It also let
  me understand that stuff like this is complicated and can take multiple **COUNTRIES** and many years to accomplish a task in this field. Which means.......... It would not be a good field for me.


  ## What surprised or intrigued you about NIU’s approach to IP, patents, and tech transfer?
  So I recall a couple specific things that came out of NIU's approach. 


  - The first one is the iGAIT team. The reason this one is so cool to me is because I am technically a part of the team. I am working more with mouth kinematics and acoustic signals but still. It's cool to see that they tried to patent but decided to go a different way

# Who did I connect with/learn from?
I had the privilege of learning from Rosendo Pili. Rosendo Pili currently works at MLH as a senior manager in customer implementation and success. Before that, he's had over 10 years in the software engineer business meaning he knows his stuff. I shot him a linked in connection 
so hopefully he connects and I can maybe even set up a talk with him! It's really cool being able to learn from people who have more experience than me and are willing to pass down their knowledge. So, thank you Rosendo Pili!

# How did this experience shape my view of open source collaboration?
**Firstly**, in the context of actual open source, there wasn't much technical knowledge gained. What I can say though is the experience was great and it is all what open source is about. Open source allows for knowledge to be gained/moved around in ways you can't even imagine.
You are able to use **thousands if not millions** of open source technologies out there meant to help you. That is exactly what GLW is all about, knowledge being passed around for people to learn for **FREE.** "Open-source knowledge" lets call it. Regardless, the entire seminar
and GHW and open source has all been great in allowing me to learn things. I came into the seminar not knowing much about open source yet here I am, knowing more than I would have ever expected.

  # Welcome back to my Blog, In today's post we are going to discuss a couple of things which are outlined below.
- What counts as a contribution in open source? 
- My thoughts on the value of code and non-code contributions. 
- How diagrams help clarify workflows. 
- How communication and collaboration shape successful non code contributions. 
- What non code contribution opportunities did you find?

# What counts as a contribution in open source?
Well, to answer this, let's define what a contribution to open source is. To me, an open source contribution could range from documentation to a full page of code.
What **MAKES** it a contribution is making it to the open source repository. Now, that's not to say that is **ALL** an open source contribution is, but for simplistic purposes, and
what this seminar has covered, that is what it is. So, with that lets define what counts as a contribution in open source, Alex Style:
```
What counts as open source contribution:
  - any successful improvement to a project that helps it be better than what it was. 
```

# My thoughts on the value of code and non-code contributions.
This one is quite straight forward. There are many things that go into an open source software, what it boils down to is two parts.
1. Code (more technical side of things Database, Source Code, etc)
2. Non-code (less technical things, README.md, documentation, translation, etc)
Okay Alex I get that, but what does it mean? It means they go hand in hand, without either, open-source would be very very difficult. Think of it like this, you can have a car(code)
but a car is useless without its driver (non-code contributions). **They have equal value!**
![meme](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30b06c29-14fa-42e9-86ab-74e9fab57b02)

#How diagrams help clarify workflows?
Well lets break this down with a real world example. Lets say you get a brand new lego set. I know really exciting right? You open the instruction manual but there are no photos. 
Well... okay so what do the instructions look like?
```
- First locate the purple piece with the small bump on the middle that has on outgoing stick and a hole, but make sure its the purple one that doesn't have the small back piece connected to it.
- Also make sure it comes out of the bag with the other pieces that are purple.
```
Woah. But do you understand what i'm saying? It makes communication faster, easier to understand. That is just one benefit. Let's look at another example. Let's say we are trying to create a database.
To stay less technical we need charts to represent what the database will look like. To show how it looks like let's look at this. 
<img width="1197" height="666" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dc4334bb-6d13-4120-abbb-d7717b21b4a0" />
As you can see, it can be beneficial to have a visual understanding of what to code, and even then, what your code looks like.

# How communication and collaboration shape successful non code contributions. 
Let's look at a README and the Contribution files. These files are arguably some of the most important when it comes to non-code contributions. But why are they successful?
That answer is easy, they are contributions effectively, using levels of collaboration and teamwork, to bring together these **VERY** important documents.

# What non code contribution opportunities did you find? 
For a deeper depth, feel free to look at the exact repo I looked at. ([Here](https://github.com/HON-310/qna-fa25/issues/127)) I looked at where my heart stays, where my eyes gaze off too:

<img width="295" height="49" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03deccb6-629a-44be-a57a-2f95fd13fdb9" />

How could I not? Back to topic. Anyways. There are a LOT of non-code contributions that have happened in this repo. Since it has been around for a while, there is a well documented README.md
AND get this, a **WHOLE WEBSITE** dedicated to contributing. But within that, there is well detailed non-code contributions that handle all, how to contribute and why to contribute.
Since a lot of the documentation and maintenance has been done, now the non-nocde contributions is translations. Translating the words on all things freeCodeCamp.
